  <strong>In brief:</strong> Staffordshire Bull Terriers are historically known as "nanny dogs" for their affection toward children. However, successful cohabitation requires clear rules, adult supervision and teaching both children and dogs appropriate behavior.
  </div>
  
  <h2>The breed's natural affinity</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>Staffies are typically patient, tolerant and affectionate with family members</li>
  <li>Robust build makes them less fragile than small breeds around active children</li>
  <li>Playful nature matches well with children's energy</li>
  <li>Strong loyalty creates deep family bonds</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Essential safety rules</h2>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Never leave unsupervised:</strong> No dog of any breed should be left alone with young children</li>
  <li><strong>Respect resting spaces:</strong> Teach children that the dog's bed is off-limits</li>
  <li><strong>No food interruption:</strong> Children must never approach a dog while eating</li>
  <li><strong>Gentle handling only:</strong> No pulling ears, tail, or climbing on the dog</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Teaching children dog body language</h2>
  <p>Help children recognize when the dog is:</p>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Happy to interact:</strong> Relaxed body, wagging tail, soft eyes</li>
  <li><strong>Needing space:</strong> Turning away, yawning, licking lips</li>
  <li><strong>Stressed:</strong> Stiff body, whale eye (showing whites), growling</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Age-appropriate interactions</h2>
  <p><strong>Toddlers (0-3):</strong> Constant supervision, brief gentle petting only, barriers when needed</p>
  <p><strong>Young children (4-7):</strong> Supervised play, simple training games, treat-giving with guidance</p>
  <p><strong>Older children (8+):</strong> Can participate in walks, training, feeding routines with oversight</p>

  <p class="callout-title">🐾 Breeder's advice</p>
  <p>We socialize puppies with children from an early age. However, the real work begins at home - consistent rules and supervision create safe, loving relationships.</p>
  </div>
  
  <h2>Building positive associations</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>Children can be treat dispensers - dog learns children equal good things</li>
  <li>Include dog in family activities calmly</li>
  <li>Praise calm interactions between child and dog</li>
  <li>Create positive routines both can participate in</li>
  </ul>
