  <span>Is the Staffordshire Bull Terrier dangerous or aggressive?</span>
  <span class="faq-toggle"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><polyline points="6 9 12 15 18 9"/></svg></span>
  </div>
  <div class="faq-answer">No, a well-selected and socialized Staffordshire Bull Terrier is not dangerous. I've been breeding this breed for over 12 years and can guarantee that with serious character selection, early socialization and responsible owners, the Staffy is an affectionate and stable dog. Aggression depends on genetics, education and environment, not the breed.</div>

  <span>Is the Staffordshire Bull Terrier suitable for children?</span>
  <span class="faq-toggle"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><polyline points="6 9 12 15 18 9"/></svg></span>
  </div>
  <div class="faq-answer">Absolutely yes. The Staffordshire Bull Terrier is traditionally called "nanny dog" for its extraordinary patience with children. In our kennel we select balanced and stable characters, perfect for families. Our Staffies grow up in contact with children, naturally developing gentleness and protectiveness.</div>

  <div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleFAQ(this)">
  <span>How much does a puppy with ENCI pedigree cost?</span>
  <span class="faq-toggle"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><polyline points="6 9 12 15 18 9"/></svg></span>
  </div>
  <div class="faq-answer">A puppy from a serious breeder with ENCI pedigree, complete genetic testing and health guarantees costs approximately €1,400 to €2,000. The price reflects years of selection, genetic testing costs (L2HGA, HC), vaccinations, microchip and quality nutrition. Be wary of prices under €1,000.</div>
  </div>
  
  <div class="faq-item">
  <div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleFAQ(this)">
  <span>What genetic tests do you perform on breeding dogs?</span>
  <span class="faq-toggle"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><polyline points="6 9 12 15 18 9"/></svg></span>
  </div>
  <div class="faq-answer">All our breeding dogs are tested for: L2HGA (L-2-Hydroxyglutaric Aciduria), HC (Hereditary Cataracts) and PHPV (eye anomaly). Testing is essential to produce healthy puppies. Every puppy is sold with certificates of the parents' tests.</div>

  <div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleFAQ(this)">
  <span>At what age can I take the puppy home?</span>

  </div>
  <div class="faq-answer">Puppies are placed after 60 days of age, as required by Italian law. This period is essential: in the first 8 weeks the puppy learns from the mother the basics of canine communication and self-control. Placing earlier is illegal and harmful.</div>

  </div>
  <div class="faq-answer">Yes, if well socialized from puppyhood. Our puppies grow up in contact with other balanced adult dogs, learning proper communication. With early and continuous socialization, the Staffy is sociable and playful. Many of our Staffies live happily with other dogs.</div>

  </div>
  <div class="faq-answer">They are two different FCI-recognized breeds. The Staffordshire Bull Terrier (English Staffy) is smaller: males 35-40 cm at 12-17 kg. The American Staffordshire Terrier (Amstaff) is larger: males 43-48 cm at 25-30 kg. The Staffy maintains the "nanny dog" character perfect for families.</div>

  </div>
  <div class="faq-answer">A well-selected Staffordshire Bull Terrier lives on average 12-14 years. It's a robust and long-lived breed. The main hereditary conditions (L2HGA, HC) are avoidable with genetic testing of breeding dogs. Our dogs often exceed 13 years.</div>

  </div>
  <div class="faq-answer">A serious breeder must have: original ENCI pedigree, documented genetic tests, puppies raised at home, possibility to visit and see the mother, maximum 1-2 litters/year per female, after-sales support. Be wary of those selling under €1,000 or not showing tests.</div>
