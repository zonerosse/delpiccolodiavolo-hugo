  <strong>In brief:</strong> The Staffordshire Bull Terrier is NOT on any dangerous breed list in Italy. Since 2009, Italy no longer has a "black list" of dangerous breeds. Owner responsibility, not breed, determines legal liability.
  </div>
  
  <h2>The Myth of "Dangerous Breeds"</h2>
  
  <p>The <strong>Staffordshire Bull Terrier</strong> is often confused with other "bull" type breeds and wrongly labeled as dangerous. In reality, the Staffy was bred as a companion dog and is known for its exceptional gentleness with children - hence the nickname "nanny dog".</p>
  
  <h2>Italian Legislation</h2>
  
  <h3>The 2009 Ordinance</h3>
  
  <p>The 2009 Ministry of Health ordinance abolished the previous list of "dangerous breeds" and established that:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>No breed is inherently dangerous</li>
  <li>All dog owners have the same responsibilities</li>
  <li>Individual dogs may be evaluated if involved in incidents</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Current Rules for All Dogs</h3>
  
  <p>In Italy, ALL dog owners must:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Use a leash (max 1.5m) in public places</li>
  <li>Carry a muzzle (not necessarily worn, but available)</li>
  <li>Have civil liability insurance (recommended)</li>
  <li>Clean up after their dog</li>
  <li>Prevent the dog from causing harm to people or animals</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Staffy Temperament: The Truth</h2>
  
  <p>The FCI breed standard describes the Staffordshire Bull Terrier as:</p>
  
  <blockquote>
  "Traditionally of indomitable courage and tenacity. Highly intelligent and affectionate, especially with children. Bold, fearless and totally reliable."
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>Studies and temperament tests consistently show Staffys to be stable, people-oriented dogs with lower aggression levels than many popular breeds.</p>
  
  <h2>Insurance and Housing</h2>
  
  <p>While not legally required, civil liability insurance is recommended for all dog owners. Some considerations:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Many homeowner policies include pet liability</li>
  <li>Specific dog insurance is available</li>
  <li>Having a pedigree and documented history helps with insurance</li>
  <li>Some landlords may have breed restrictions - check before renting</li>
  </ul>
  
  <div class="callout">
  <p class="callout-title">📋 Documentation Matters</p>
  <p>A Staffordshire Bull Terrier with <strong>ENCI pedigree</strong> clearly establishes breed identity. This can be important for insurance and housing. At <a href="/en/">Del Piccolo Diavolo</a>, all our puppies come with official pedigree documentation.</p>
  </div>
  
  <h2>Responsible Ownership</h2>
  
  <p>The best way to prevent problems is responsible ownership:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Proper socialization from puppyhood</li>
  <li>Obedience training</li>
  <li>Adequate exercise and mental stimulation</li>
  <li>Neutering/spaying if not breeding</li>
  <li>Supervised interactions with children and other animals</li>
  </ul>
