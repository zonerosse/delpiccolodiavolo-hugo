  <strong>In brief:</strong> <a href="/en/">Staffordshire Bull Terrier</a>, American Pit Bull Terrier and American Staffordshire Terrier are three distinct breeds, often confused with each other. The <strong>Staffy</strong> is the smallest (max 17 kg), the <strong>Amstaff</strong> is the largest and most muscular (up to 35 kg), while the <strong>Pit Bull</strong> (APBT) is not recognized by the FCI.
  </div>
  
  <h2>Why Are These Breeds Confused?</h2>
  
  <p>The confusion between <strong>Staffordshire Bull Terrier</strong>, <strong>American Pit Bull Terrier</strong> and <strong>American Staffordshire Terrier</strong> is extremely common, not only among laypeople but also in the media and sometimes in institutions. This confusion has concrete consequences: poorly written laws, unjustified prejudices and difficulties for owners.</p>
  
  <p>All three breeds descend from the same stock: the "Bull and Terrier" dogs of 19th century England, crosses between Bulldogs and various Terriers. They therefore share a common genetic heritage and some similar morphological characteristics: broad head, powerful jaw, muscular body.</p>

  </figure>
  
  <p>The media tend to use the generic term "Pitbull" to indicate any "bull" type dog, regardless of the actual breed. When a molosser-type dog is involved in an incident, the breed is rarely correctly identified, fueling generalized stereotypes.</p>
  
  <h2>Historical Origins: A Common Ancestor</h2>
  
  <h3>19th Century England: Bull and Terrier</h3>
  
  <p>In the 19th century, animal fights were popular in England. The <strong>Bull and Terrier</strong> were born from crosses between Bulldogs (strength, grip) and Terriers (agility, tenacity). These dogs were used for "bull-baiting" and later, after the 1835 ban, for dog fights.</p>
  
  <h3>Staffordshire Bull Terrier: The British Breed</h3>
  
  <p>The <strong>Staffordshire Bull Terrier</strong> developed in the Staffordshire region of England. In 1935 it was officially recognized by the British Kennel Club. The FCI recognizes the Staffordshire Bull Terrier with <strong>standard n. 76</strong>, in Group 3 (Terriers), Section 3 (Bull type Terriers).</p>
  
  <h3>American Breeds: Pit Bull and Amstaff</h3>
  
  <p><strong>American Pit Bull Terrier (APBT):</strong> Recognized by the UKC (United Kennel Club) in 1898 and by the ADBA. The APBT is <strong>NOT recognized by the FCI</strong> or the AKC.</p>
  
  <p><strong>American Staffordshire Terrier:</strong> In 1936, the AKC recognized a "show" version of American Pit Bulls with the name "Staffordshire Terrier", later renamed "American Staffordshire Terrier" in 1972. The FCI recognizes it with <strong>standard n. 286</strong>.</p>

  <p>The Amstaff, selected for shows, tends to have a slightly calmer temperament than the APBT. The AKC standard describes it as "good with children, reliable, trustworthy".</p>
