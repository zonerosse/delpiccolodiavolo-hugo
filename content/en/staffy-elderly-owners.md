  <strong>In brief:</strong> Staffordshire Bull Terriers can make excellent companions for active elderly owners. Their moderate size, affectionate nature and adaptability suit many lifestyles, though honest assessment of exercise capabilities is essential.
  </div>
  
  <h2>Why Staffies suit some elderly owners</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>Compact size (11-17kg) - manageable for most people</li>
  <li>Deeply affectionate and loyal - excellent companions</li>
  <li>Adaptable to calmer routines with age</li>
  <li>Short coat requires minimal grooming</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Honest considerations</h2>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Pulling strength:</strong> Young Staffies can pull hard on leash - training essential</li>
  <li><strong>Exercise needs:</strong> Still require 1-2 hours activity daily</li>
  <li><strong>Puppy energy:</strong> First 2 years are demanding - consider adult adoption</li>
  <li><strong>Veterinary costs:</strong> Budget for health care throughout dog's life</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Making it work</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>Consider adopting an adult dog (3+ years) with known temperament</li>
  <li>Invest in professional training for leash manners</li>
  <li>Mental stimulation can partially substitute physical exercise</li>
  <li>Arrange backup care for emergencies</li>
  </ul>
  
  <div class="callout">
  <p class="callout-title">🐾 Breeder's advice</p>
  <p>We carefully match dogs to owners. For elderly buyers, we discuss realistic expectations and may suggest visiting adult dogs in need of homes rather than high-energy puppies.</p>
  </div>
  
  <h2>Benefits of dog ownership for elderly</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>Increased daily activity and outdoor time</li>
  <li>Routine and purpose</li>
  <li>Reduced loneliness and depression</li>
  <li>Social opportunities with other dog owners</li>
  </ul>
