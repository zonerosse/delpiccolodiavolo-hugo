  <div class="lead"><strong>In brief:</strong> Staffordshire Bull Terriers are athletic dogs requiring regular exercise, but overexertion - especially in puppies - can damage developing joints. Balance activity with rest for a healthy, happy dog.</div>
  <h2>Exercise by age</h2>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Puppies (under 12 months):</strong> 5 minutes per month of age, twice daily. Focus on play and mental stimulation.</li>
  <li><strong>Adolescents (1-2 years):</strong> Gradually increase to 1-2 hours daily, avoiding repetitive high-impact activities.</li>
  <li><strong>Adults (2+ years):</strong> 1-2 hours of varied activity - walks, play, training, swimming.</li>
  <li><strong>Seniors (7+ years):</strong> Adjust to individual ability, shorter but frequent outings.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Activities to enjoy</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>Brisk walks on varied terrain</li>
  <li>Swimming - excellent low-impact exercise</li>
  <li>Fetch and tug games (controlled)</li>
  <li>Nose work and scent games</li>
  <li>Training sessions</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Activities to limit or avoid</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>Long-distance running (especially on hard surfaces)</li>
  <li>Jumping from heights</li>
  <li>Extended stair climbing (puppies)</li>
  <li>Exercise in extreme heat - Staffies overheat easily</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="callout"><p class="callout-title">🐾 Breeder's advice</p>
  <p>Mental exercise tires dogs too. A 15-minute training session can be as satisfying as a longer walk. Balance physical and mental stimulation.</p></div>
