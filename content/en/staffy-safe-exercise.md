  <strong>In brief:</strong> The Staffordshire Bull Terrier is an athletic, energetic breed that needs regular exercise for physical and mental health. However, exercise must be appropriate for age and physical condition to prevent injuries.
  </div>
  
  <h2>Exercise Needs by Age</h2>
  
  <h3>Puppies (0-12 months)</h3>
  
  <p>Puppies have growing bones and joints that are vulnerable to damage. The general rule is:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><strong>5 minutes of exercise per month of age, twice daily</strong></li>
  <li>A 3-month-old puppy: 15 minutes twice daily</li>
  <li>A 6-month-old puppy: 30 minutes twice daily</li>
  <li>Avoid jumping, stairs and intense running until bones mature</li>
  </ul>
  
  <div class="alert">
  <p class="alert-title">⚠️ Puppy Safety</p>
  <p>Over-exercising puppies can cause permanent joint damage. Short, frequent play sessions are better than long walks.</p>
  </div>
  
  <h3>Adults (1-7 years)</h3>
  
  <p>Adult Staffys need 1-2 hours of exercise daily:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>At least one 30-45 minute walk</li>
  <li>Play sessions with fetch, tug toys</li>
  <li>Mental stimulation games</li>
  <li>Swimming (excellent low-impact exercise)</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Seniors (7+ years)</h3>
  
  <p>Older Staffys still need exercise but at a gentler pace:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Shorter, more frequent walks</li>
  <li>Low-impact activities</li>
  <li>Swimming for joint-friendly exercise</li>
  <li>Watch for signs of fatigue or pain</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Fun Activities for Staffys</h2>
  
  <p>Staffys excel at many activities:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Fetch and retrieval games:</strong> Great for burning energy</li>
  <li><strong>Tug-of-war:</strong> Staffys love this! Use appropriate toys</li>
  <li><strong>Agility:</strong> For adults with proper training</li>
  <li><strong>Swimming:</strong> Many Staffys love water</li>
  <li><strong>Nose work:</strong> Mental stimulation through scent games</li>
  <li><strong>Hiking:</strong> Great bonding activity</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Weather Considerations</h2>
  
  <h3>Hot Weather</h3>
  
  <p>Staffys can overheat quickly due to their muscular build:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Exercise early morning or evening</li>
  <li>Always provide fresh water</li>
  <li>Watch for signs of heatstroke</li>
  <li>Never leave in hot cars</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Cold Weather</h3>
  
  <p>Short coat means Staffys feel the cold:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Consider a coat for winter walks</li>
  <li>Protect paws from ice and salt</li>
  <li>Keep walks shorter in extreme cold</li>
  </ul>
