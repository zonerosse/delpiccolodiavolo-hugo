  <h2>Home dental care</h2>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Brushing:</strong> Daily or several times weekly with dog-specific toothpaste</li>
  <li><strong>Dental chews:</strong> VOHC-approved products help reduce plaque</li>
  <li><strong>Water additives:</strong> Some help reduce bacteria</li>
  <li><strong>Raw bones:</strong> Controversial - can help or cause fractures; supervise carefully</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Signs of dental problems</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>Bad breath (not normal!)</li>
  <li>Yellow/brown buildup on teeth</li>
  <li>Red, swollen or bleeding gums</li>
  <li>Difficulty eating, dropping food</li>
  <li>Pawing at mouth</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Professional dental care</h2>
  <p>Annual veterinary dental check recommended. Professional cleaning under anesthesia may be needed periodically to remove tartar below the gum line where brushing can't reach.</p>
  <div class="callout"><p class="callout-title">🐾 Breeder's advice</p>
  <p>Start handling your puppy's mouth from day one. Make it positive with treats. Adult dogs who weren't desensitized as puppies are much harder to brush.</p></div>
