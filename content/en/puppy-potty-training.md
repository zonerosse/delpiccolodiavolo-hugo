  <strong>In brief:</strong> Setting up proper potty training in the first months makes cohabitation more peaceful and accelerates your Staffordshire Bull Terrier puppy's independence. Clear routines, frequent outings and lots of positive reinforcement are needed.
  </div>
  
  <h2>Basic routine for the puppy</h2>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Scheduled outings:</strong> upon waking, after meals, after play, before bed.</li>
  <li><strong>Initial frequency:</strong> every 2–3 hours, then gradually spaced out.</li>
  <li><strong>Same spot and same keyword</strong> (e.g., "potty"): helps with association.</li>
  <li><strong>Immediate reinforcement:</strong> treat and calm voice within 2–3 seconds of the event.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Signs that indicate "about to go"</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>Sniffing the ground in small circles, isolating or getting restless.</li>
  <li>Suddenly interrupting play and heading toward doors or pads.</li>
  <li>Walking in circles or quick squatting.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Managing indoor accidents</h2>
  <p>No scolding after the fact: the dog doesn't connect the error if not caught in the moment. Clean with enzymatic cleaners (avoid bleach/ammonia) and resume the routine.</p>
  
  <div class="callout">
  <p class="callout-title">🐾 Breeder's advice</p>
  <p>If you catch them in the act, gently interrupt and take them outside; only reward when they've finished in the correct spot.</p>
  </div>
  
  <h2>Potty pads: yes or no?</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>Useful in apartments or for nighttime emergencies; reduce use over time.</li>
  <li>Place away from bed and bowls; don't move it constantly.</li>
  <li>Goal: gradually transfer the need outdoors.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Weekly progression (indicative)</h2>
  
  <h3>Weeks 8–12</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>Outings every 2–3 hours, including a late evening outing.</li>
  <li>Short sessions, calm environment, generous rewards.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Weeks 12–16</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>Extend to every 3–4 hours if accidents decrease.</li>
  <li>Introduce a consistent keyword and post-meal routine.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>From 4 months</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>Consolidate 4–5 outings per day; maintain the first one upon waking.</li>
  <li>Gradually reduce pads if present.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Factors that influence timing</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>Feeding schedule and meal times (regularity helps predictability).</li>
  <li>Physical activity and sleep: after play and naps, take them out.</li>
  <li>Weather and surfaces: some puppies hesitate in rain/cold grass; bring a mat or choose sheltered areas.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>When to seek support</h2>
  <p>If after 2–3 weeks of routine, accidents aren't decreasing, consider a consultation with a trainer and a vet check to rule out medical causes.</p>
