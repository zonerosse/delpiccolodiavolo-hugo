  <strong>In brief:</strong> Staffordshire Bull Terriers can live harmoniously with other pets when properly introduced and managed. Individual temperament, early socialization and realistic expectations are key to success.
  </div>
  
  <h2>Understanding breed tendencies</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>Terrier heritage means some prey drive toward small animals</li>
  <li>Same-sex dog aggression can develop, especially after maturity</li>
  <li>Individual variation is significant - many Staffies live peacefully with cats and other dogs</li>
  <li>Early socialization dramatically improves outcomes</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Living with cats</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>Best success when puppy raised with cats from young age</li>
  <li>Always provide cat escape routes (high spaces, baby gates)</li>
  <li>Never leave unsupervised until relationship is thoroughly established</li>
  <li>Some individual Staffies will never be safe with cats</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Living with other dogs</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>Opposite-sex pairings generally work better</li>
  <li>Neuter/spay can reduce conflict</li>
  <li>Resource guarding must be managed carefully</li>
  <li>Separate feeding stations and valuable resources</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Small animals (rabbits, guinea pigs, etc.)</h2>
  <p>High risk due to prey drive. If you have small pets, ensure completely secure enclosures with no possibility of access. Many Staffies cannot be trusted around small prey animals regardless of training.</p>
  
  <div class="callout">
  <p class="callout-title">🐾 Breeder's advice</p>
  <p>Be honest about your household composition when selecting a puppy. We can help match temperament to situation, but cannot guarantee compatibility with every pet type.</p>
  </div>
  
  <h2>Introduction protocol</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>Gradual introduction over weeks, not days</li>
  <li>Initial separation with scent exchange</li>
  <li>Controlled visual introductions behind barriers</li>
  <li>Short supervised interactions, gradually increasing</li>
  <li>Watch for stress signals and separate before problems</li>
  </ul>
