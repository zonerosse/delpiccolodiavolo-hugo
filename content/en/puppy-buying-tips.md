  <div class="lead">
  <strong>Basic principle:</strong> A quality puppy from a serious breeding costs more initially, but saves thousands in health and behavioral problems. Choosing the breeder is the most important decision.
  </div>
  
  <h2>What to ask the breeder</h2>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Parents:</strong> temperament, show results, mandatory genetic tests (L-2HGA, HC), specialist exams (PHPV eyes, heart). Ask to see certificates.</li>
  <li><strong>Pedigree:</strong> bloodline, complete genealogy and kennel club documentation. A puppy without pedigree is not purebred.</li>
  <li><strong>Development:</strong> food used since weaning, deworming done, microchip, first vaccinations with health booklet.</li>
  <li><strong>Socialization:</strong> experiences the puppy has had, exposure to household noises, handling, crate, car.</li>
  <li><strong>Contract and guarantees:</strong> written sales conditions, health guarantees, repurchase clauses, guaranteed after-sales support.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Evaluating time and lifestyle</h2>
  <p>A Staffordshire Bull Terrier puppy requires constant daily presence, structured routines and lots of patience. Realistically consider your work hours, available home space, vacation management and actual family support. Plan a reference dog trainer experienced with the breed from the start.</p>
  
  <div class="callout">
  <p class="callout-title">💡 Reality check</p>
  <p>In the first 3-6 months, the puppy will require attention comparable to a small child. If you work full-time away from home, seriously consider alternative solutions (dog sitter, family dog, dog daycare).</p>
  </div>
  
  <h2>Real costs to budget</h2>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Vet first year:</strong> check-ups, antiparasitic prophylaxis, vaccines, possible emergencies. Minimum budget: €500-800.</li>
  <li><strong>Food:</strong> quality premium food appropriate for growth. Monthly budget: €80-120.</li>
  <li><strong>Training and activities:</strong> puppy classes, dog trainer, enrichment toys, quality leash gear. Budget: €300-600.</li>
  <li><strong>Insurance and registrations:</strong> mandatory liability insurance, registry enrollments. Annual budget: €100-200.</li>
  <li><strong>Initial equipment:</strong> crate, bed, bowls, harness, leashes, toys. Initial budget: €200-400.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Positive signs of a good breeding</h2>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Total transparency:</strong> gladly shows genetic tests, specialist exams, complete genealogies of parents.</li>
  <li><strong>Well-maintained environment:</strong> puppies raised at home or in clean, spacious, stimulating area. No dirty cages or neglected dogs.</li>
  <li><strong>Questions for you:</strong> a serious breeder wants to understand where the puppy will go, asks many questions about your family, experience, lifestyle.</li>
  <li><strong>After-sales support:</strong> availability to follow the family even after delivery, reachability for advice, owner group.</li>
  <li><strong>No rush:</strong> invites you to visit multiple times, meet the parents, see more litters. Doesn't push for immediate sale.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Red flags: warning signs to avoid</h2>
  <div class="alert">
  <p class="alert-title">⚠️ Avoid those who...</p>
  <ul>
  <li>❌ Sell puppies without pedigree or "with optional pedigree for extra payment"</li>
  <li>❌ Don't show the parents or say they're "not available"</li>
  <li>❌ Have no genetic tests or say "not needed because my dogs are healthy"</li>
  <li>❌ Deliver puppies before 60 days of age</li>
  <li>❌ Always have puppies available of all ages (puppy mill)</li>
  <li>❌ Propose delivery at service stations or third-party locations instead of at the kennel</li>
  <li>❌ Prices too low compared to market average (€500-800 is suspicious)</li>
  </ul>
  </div>
  
  <h2>Essential genetic tests for Staffy</h2>
  <p>The Staffordshire Bull Terrier has hereditary predisposition to some conditions. A serious breeding ALWAYS tests breeding stock for:</p>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>L-2HGA</strong> (L-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria): severe neurological disease. Mandatory DNA test.</li>
  <li><strong>HC</strong> (hereditary cataracts): lens opacity leading to blindness. Mandatory DNA test.</li>
  <li><strong>PHPV</strong> (persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous): eye anomaly. Specialist eye exam.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Always ask to see original certificates, don't settle for "I'll tell you verbally". Tests cost money and a serious breeder does them.</p>
  
  <h2>Final checklist before deciding</h2>
  <div class="checklist">
  <p class="checklist-title">✅ Verify you've completed everything</p>
  <ul>
  <li>I've visited the kennel in person or via detailed video call.</li>
  <li>I've seen both puppy's parents (at least the mother).</li>
  <li>I've received and verified: pedigree, genetic tests, health booklet, written contract.</li>
  <li>I'm clear on the time commitment (6+ hours daily in first months).</li>
  <li>I've prepared the budget: €2,000-3,000 first year all included.</li>
  <li>I've identified a trusted vet and dog trainer.</li>
  <li>I've prepared the home: crate, pen, bed, bowls, toys, leash gear.</li>
  <li>The whole family agrees and is aware of the commitment.</li>
  </ul>
  </div>
  
  <div class="callout">
  <p class="callout-title">🐾 Breeder's advice</p>
  <p>At our Del Piccolo Diavolo kennel, we always provide complete documentation (pedigree, certified genetic tests, vaccination plan, guarantee contract) and remain available for lifetime support. A breeder who disappears after the sale is not a serious breeder.</p>
