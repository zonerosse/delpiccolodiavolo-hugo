  <strong>In brief:</strong> Getting a Staffordshire Bull Terrier puppy used to staying alone is a gradual process. The goal is to create positive associations, predictable routines and safe environments, preventing separation anxiety and destructive behaviors.
  </div>
  
  <div class="info-box">
  <p class="info-box-title">🎯 Key objectives</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Stable routines (sleep, meals, outings, play)</li>
  <li>Progressive exposure to solitude</li>
  <li>Environmental enrichment and chewing</li>
  <li>Prevention of hyper-attachment</li>
  </ul>
  </div>
  
  <h2>Preparing the environment</h2>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Dedicated rest area:</strong> bed or pen/x-pen in a quiet area, adequate temperature, water available.</li>
  <li><strong>Safety:</strong> remove cables, toxic plants, fragile objects; leave only safe, sturdy toys.</li>
  <li><strong>Background noise:</strong> ambient sounds or soft music at low volume can help.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Routine and predictable signals</h2>
  <p>Make the day readable: alternate activities (play, chewing, walks) with relaxation moments. Include brief rituals before leaving and returning home, keeping tones neutral.</p>
  
  <h2>Gradual protocol (7–14 days)</h2>
  
  <h3>Phase 1 — Micro absences at home (1–3 days)</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>Close the gate/pen for 30–60 seconds while staying in sight; return and reward calmness.</li>
  <li>Repeat multiple times, then leave the room for 30–90 seconds. Slowly increase duration.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Phase 2 — Very brief outings (3–7 days)</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>Leave home for 1–3 minutes after a calming activity (sniffing/light walk, chewing).</li>
  <li>Return neutrally. If you find agitation, reduce duration in the next session.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Phase 3 — Consolidation (up to 30–60 minutes)</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>Extend non-linearly: 5', 8', 4', 12', 6', 15'… Alternating up/down helps avoid expectations.</li>
  <li>Include "chewing breaks" with safe stuffed toys to make absence more pleasant.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <div class="callout">
  <p class="callout-title">🐾 Breeder's advice</p>
  <p>With young Staffordshire Bull Terriers, avoid exhausting them completely. Sniffing and chewing activities that center them work better than frantic running before absences.</p>
  </div>
  
  <h2>Chewing and enrichment</h2>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Stuffed toys:</strong> with safe recipes and measured portions from their meal.</li>
  <li><strong>Resource rotation:</strong> 2–3 different objects on rotation to maintain interest.</li>
  <li><strong>Sniffing games:</strong> snuffle mats or kibble scattered in a cardboard box.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Preventing hyper-attachment</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>Don't always follow the puppy and don't let them follow you everywhere; use gate/pen positively.</li>
  <li>Sober greetings and returns: no excessive celebrations, reward calmness when they sit or lie down.</li>
  <li>Guided independence: encourage brief "everyone for themselves" moments even when home.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Stress signals to monitor</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>Prolonged vocalizations, hypersalivation, destruction aimed at doors/windows, inappropriate elimination.</li>
  <li>If these appear, return to the duration where they were calm and progress more slowly.</li>
  <li>If they persist, consult with vet and qualified trainer.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>How long can a puppy stay alone?</h2>
  <p>Prudent rule: up to 1–2 hours with adequate preparation in the first months, gradually increasing. Arrange family support or pet-sitter for longer days.</p>
  
  <div class="checklist">
  <p class="checklist-title">📋 Quick checklist</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Safe area ready (pen/x-pen, water, suitable toys)</li>
  <li>Defined daily routine and pre-departure signal</li>
  <li>Gradual protocol planned with non-linear durations</li>
  <li>Stress signal monitoring and fallback if needed</li>
  </ul>
