  <div class="lead"><strong>In brief:</strong> L-2HGA and HC are inherited diseases in Staffordshire Bull Terriers that can be completely prevented through genetic testing and responsible breeding. Always buy from tested parents.</div>
  <h2>L-2HGA (L-2-Hydroxyglutaric Aciduria)</h2>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>What it is:</strong> Neurological disease causing seizures, ataxia, behavioral changes</li>
  <li><strong>Inheritance:</strong> Recessive - needs two copies of defective gene</li>
  <li><strong>Symptoms appear:</strong> Usually between 6 months and 1 year</li>
  <li><strong>Treatment:</strong> No cure - management only</li>
  <li><strong>Prevention:</strong> DNA test both parents; never breed two carriers</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>HC (Hereditary Cataracts)</h2>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>What it is:</strong> Progressive lens opacity leading to blindness</li>
  <li><strong>Inheritance:</strong> Recessive</li>
  <li><strong>Symptoms appear:</strong> Typically by 2-3 years</li>
  <li><strong>Treatment:</strong> Surgery possible in some cases</li>
  <li><strong>Prevention:</strong> DNA test both parents</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Understanding test results</h2>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Clear:</strong> No copies of defective gene - safe</li>
  <li><strong>Carrier:</strong> One copy - healthy but can pass gene on</li>
  <li><strong>Affected:</strong> Two copies - will develop disease</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Clear x Clear = all puppies clear<br>Clear x Carrier = puppies clear or carrier (all healthy)<br>Carrier x Carrier = risk of affected puppies - avoid this breeding</p>
  <div class="callout"><p class="callout-title">🐾 Breeder's advice</p>
  <p>All our breeding dogs are DNA tested for L-2HGA and HC. We provide certificates with every puppy. Never buy from a breeder who doesn't test - these diseases are preventable.</p></div>
