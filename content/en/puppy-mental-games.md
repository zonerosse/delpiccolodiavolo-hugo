  <strong>In brief:</strong> Mental stimulation is just as important as physical exercise for your Staffordshire Bull Terrier puppy. Sniffing games, food puzzles and enrichment activities develop problem-solving skills, build self-control and provide calming mental fatigue.
  </div>
  
  <h2>Why mental games matter</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>15 minutes of mental work equals 30+ minutes of physical exercise in terms of tiredness</li>
  <li>Builds focus, patience and impulse control - essential for the breed</li>
  <li>Reduces boredom-related behaviors like chewing, barking or hyperactivity</li>
  <li>Strengthens the bond between you and your puppy</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Sniffing games</h2>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Scatter feeding:</strong> Throw kibble in grass or on a textured mat</li>
  <li><strong>Snuffle mats:</strong> Hide treats in fabric strips for nose work</li>
  <li><strong>Box searches:</strong> Crumpled paper in a cardboard box with hidden treats</li>
  <li><strong>Trail games:</strong> Drag a treat along the floor leaving a scent trail</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Food puzzles</h2>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Stuffed Kongs:</strong> Layer wet food, kibble, treats - freeze for longer activity</li>
  <li><strong>Lick mats:</strong> Spread peanut butter or wet food - promotes calm licking</li>
  <li><strong>Puzzle feeders:</strong> Start simple, increase difficulty gradually</li>
  <li><strong>Muffin tin game:</strong> Hide treats under tennis balls in tin slots</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="callout-title">🐾 Breeder's advice</p>
  <p>Staffordshire Bull Terriers are intelligent but can get frustrated quickly. Start with easy wins, then gradually increase difficulty. End sessions before frustration sets in.</p>
  </div>
  
  <h2>Building self-control</h2>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Wait games:</strong> Practice waiting before meals, before going through doors</li>
  <li><strong>"Leave it" foundation:</strong> Reward looking away from treats on the floor</li>
  <li><strong>Impulse control exercises:</strong> Toss treat, reward for waiting for release cue</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Age-appropriate activities</h2>
  <p><strong>8-12 weeks:</strong> Simple sniffing, easy stuffed toys, short sessions (5 min)</p>
  <p><strong>3-4 months:</strong> Basic puzzles, scatter feeding, beginning impulse control</p>
  <p><strong>5-6 months:</strong> More complex puzzles, longer sessions, chained behaviors</p>
  
  <h2>DIY enrichment ideas</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>Toilet paper tubes with kibble inside, ends folded</li>
  <li>Egg cartons with treats under each lid</li>
  <li>Towel rolled up with treats hidden in layers</li>
  <li>Ice cubes with treats frozen inside (summer favorite)</li>
  </ul>
