  <strong>In brief:</strong> Feeding during the first weeks at home is crucial for growth, gut health and your Staffordshire Bull Terrier puppy's wellbeing. Here you'll find guideline portions, meal frequency and how to manage the transition from breeder's food to yours.
  </div>
  
  <h2>Meal frequency and timing</h2>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>2–3 months:</strong> 4 meals per day, spaced about 4 hours apart.</li>
  <li><strong>3–5 months:</strong> 3 meals per day.</li>
  <li><strong>6–12 months:</strong> 2 meals per day (morning/evening) and maintain this as an adult.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="callout-title">💡 Consistency beats quantity</p>
  <p>Regular schedules help digestion, potty routine and self-control.</p>
  </div>
  
  <h2>Daily portion: how to gauge</h2>
  <p>Follow the plan provided by the breeder and manufacturer guidelines. Adjust portions based on body condition, activity level and growth.</p>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Start:</strong> use the same portion and food provided by the breeder for 7–10 days.</li>
  <li><strong>Monitoring:</strong> feel the ribs (detectable but not visible), slight waist, good energy.</li>
  <li><strong>Adjust</strong> by 5–10% at a time based on stools, appetite and growth curve.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Gradual food transition</h2>
  <p>If changing brand or formula, proceed in steps to avoid loose stools and bowl refusal:</p>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Days 1–3:</strong> 75% old – 25% new</li>
  <li><strong>Days 4–6:</strong> 50% – 50%</li>
  <li><strong>Days 7–9:</strong> 25% – 75%</li>
  <li><strong>From day 10:</strong> 100% new</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Water and hydration</h2>
  <p>Fresh water always available, away from the sleeping area. In summer or after play, offer frequent water breaks. Avoid cow's milk: it often causes digestive upset.</p>
  
  <h2>Treats and chewing</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>Choose soft, small treats for training; these count towards daily allowance.</li>
  <li>Puppy-appropriate chews, under supervision; avoid cooked bones and hard pieces that can splinter.</li>
  <li>Prefer "functional" rewards after main meals to reduce greediness.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Supplements: when truly needed</h2>
  <p>With a balanced complete "puppy" food, supplements aren't necessary. Consult your vet only in specific cases (e.g., probiotics after treatment, omega-3, joint support for prone lines) and never DIY.</p>
  
  <h2>Signs to monitor</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>Well-formed, shiny but not hard stools.</li>
  <li>Shiny coat, skin without dandruff and minimal itching.</li>
  <li>Steady weight gain; watch for sudden increases or drops.</li>
  <li>Recurring vomiting, persistent loose stools or intense itching require veterinary consultation.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Staffordshire Bull Terrier: specific notes</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>Active, muscular breed: adequate protein and fat for puppy needs.</li>
  <li>Portioning meals reduces the risk of gulping and aerophagia.</li>
  <li>Use part of the ration in daily training to combine nutrition and education.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <div class="callout">
  <p class="callout-title">🐾 Breeder's advice</p>
  <p>Keep the breeder's food for the first week in your new home. Only change if necessary and always gradually.</p>
