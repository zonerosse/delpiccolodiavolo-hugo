  <strong>In brief:</strong> Dental health is essential for the overall well-being of the Staffordshire Bull Terrier. Poor oral hygiene can lead to tartar, gingivitis and more serious problems. Regular tooth brushing, quality dental snacks and periodic veterinary checks are the keys to a healthy mouth.
  </div>
  
  <h2>Why Dental Health Matters</h2>
  
  <p>Dental problems are among the most common health issues in dogs. Without proper care, bacteria accumulate and form plaque, which hardens into tartar. This can lead to gingivitis, periodontitis, tooth loss and even systemic infections affecting heart and kidneys.</p>
  
  <p>The <strong>Staffordshire Bull Terrier</strong> has a strong jaw and generally good teeth, but like all breeds needs regular dental care to maintain optimal health throughout life.</p>
  
  <h2>How to Clean Your Staffy's Teeth</h2>
  
  <h3>Toothbrush and Toothpaste</h3>
  
  <p>Daily brushing is the gold standard for dental care:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Use dog-specific toothpaste</strong> - Never human toothpaste, which contains fluoride and xylitol toxic to dogs</li>
  <li><strong>Choose an appropriate brush</strong> - Finger brushes are great for beginners</li>
  <li><strong>Start gradually</strong> - Let your dog get used to the taste and sensation</li>
  <li><strong>Brush in circular motions</strong> - Focus on the gum line where plaque accumulates</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Dental Snacks and Chews</h3>
  
  <p>Quality dental chews can complement brushing:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Look for VOHC (Veterinary Oral Health Council) approved products</li>
  <li>Choose appropriate size for your Staffy</li>
  <li>Supervise chewing to prevent choking</li>
  <li>Raw bones can help but carry risks - consult your vet</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Warning Signs of Dental Problems</h2>
  
  <p>Watch for these symptoms:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Bad breath (halitosis)</li>
  <li>Yellow or brown deposits on teeth</li>
  <li>Red, swollen or bleeding gums</li>
  <li>Difficulty eating or chewing on one side</li>
  <li>Drooling more than usual</li>
  <li>Pawing at the mouth</li>
  <li>Loose or missing teeth</li>
  </ul>
  
  <div class="alert">
  <p class="alert-title">⚠️ When to See the Vet</p>
  <p>If you notice any of these signs, schedule a dental examination. Early intervention prevents more serious problems and expensive treatments.</p>
  </div>
  
  <h2>Professional Dental Cleaning</h2>
  
  <p>Even with good home care, most dogs benefit from professional cleaning every 1-2 years. This involves:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>General anesthesia for thorough cleaning</li>
  <li>Scaling to remove tartar above and below the gum line</li>
  <li>Polishing to smooth tooth surfaces</li>
  <li>Full oral examination and X-rays if needed</li>
  </ul>
