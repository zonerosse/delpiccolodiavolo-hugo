  <strong>In brief:</strong> <strong>L2-HGA</strong> (L-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria) and <strong>HC</strong> (Hereditary Cataract) are two genetic diseases specific to the Staffordshire Bull Terrier. Both are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner: a puppy can only become ill if <em>both</em> parents are carriers. A responsible breeder always tests breeding dogs and never mates two carriers together, guaranteeing healthy puppies.
  </div>
  
  <h2>Why Genetic Testing is Essential</h2>
  
  <p>The <strong>Staffordshire Bull Terrier</strong> is a generally healthy and robust breed, with a life expectancy of 12-14 years. However, like many purebreds, it has some genetic predispositions that can be completely controlled through DNA testing and responsible breeding.</p>
  
  <p>The two most important genetic conditions in the breed are <strong>L2-HGA</strong> and <strong>HC</strong>. Both have been identified, genetically mapped, and reliable DNA tests now exist that allow knowing the genetic status of each dog before breeding.</p>

  </figure>
  
  <p>This means that <strong>no puppy should be born sick</strong> with L2-HGA or HC, as long as the breeder does the tests and plans matings correctly.</p>
  
  <h2>L2-HGA: What It Is and How It Manifests</h2>
  
  <p><strong>L-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria</strong> (L2-HGA) is a neurological metabolic disease first identified in the Staffordshire Bull Terrier in 2003 by researchers at the British Animal Health Trust.</p>
  
  <h3>The Genetic Cause</h3>
  
  <p>L2-HGA is caused by a mutation in the <strong>L2HGDH</strong> gene. The disease is inherited in an <strong>autosomal recessive</strong> manner:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>A dog can be <strong>CLEAR</strong> (healthy, no copies of the mutated gene)</li>
  <li>A dog can be <strong>CARRIER</strong> (healthy carrier, one copy of the mutated gene)</li>
  <li>A dog can be <strong>AFFECTED</strong> (sick, two copies of the mutated gene)</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Symptoms</h3>
  
  <p>L2-HGA symptoms typically appear between 6 months and the first year of life. Clinical signs include:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Epileptic seizures (often the first symptom noticed)</li>
  <li>Ataxia (lack of coordination in movements)</li>
  <li>Tremors, especially when excited or stressed</li>
  <li>Muscle stiffness</li>
  <li>Learning difficulties and behavioral changes</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>The disease is <strong>progressive and incurable</strong>. Affected dogs have compromised quality of life.</p>
  
  <h2>HC (Hereditary Cataract): What It Is</h2>
  
  <p><strong>Hereditary Cataract</strong> (HC) is an eye condition that causes lens opacity and, if untreated, can lead to blindness.</p>
  
  <p>HC is also caused by a specific genetic mutation, identified in the <strong>HSF4</strong> gene. Like L2-HGA, it is inherited in an <strong>autosomal recessive</strong> manner.</p>
  
  <p>Hereditary cataract in the Staffy tends to develop at a relatively young age (from 1-2 years). Unlike L2-HGA, cataracts can be surgically treated with good results, but surgery is expensive and requires demanding post-operative care.</p>
  
  <h2>How Genetic Tests Work</h2>
  
  <h3>Sample Collection</h3>
  
  <p>The test only requires a DNA sample, which can be obtained via:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Buccal swab:</strong> The most common method. A cotton swab is rubbed inside the dog's cheek to collect cells. Painless and can be done at home.</li>
  <li><strong>Blood sample:</strong> Performed by a veterinarian.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Accredited Laboratories</h3>
  
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Animal Health Trust (UK)</strong> - The lab that developed both tests (now part of The Kennel Club)</li>
  <li><strong>Laboklin</strong> - German laboratory</li>
  <li><strong>Optigen</strong> - American laboratory</li>
  <li><strong>Embark</strong> - Complete genetic test</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Interpreting Results</h3>
  
  <table>
  <thead>
  <tr>
  <th>Result</th>
  <th>Meaning</th>
  <th>Can Breed?</th>
  </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
  <tr>
  <td><strong>CLEAR</strong></td>
  <td>No copies of mutated gene. Dog is healthy and won't transmit disease.</td>
  <td>✅ Yes, with any partner</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td><strong>CARRIER</strong></td>
  <td>One copy of mutated gene. Dog is healthy but can transmit gene.</td>
  <td>✅ Yes, but ONLY with CLEAR partner</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td><strong>AFFECTED</strong></td>
  <td>Two copies of mutated gene. Dog will develop disease.</td>
  <td>❌ No, should not breed</td>
  </tr>
  </tbody>
  </table>
  
  <div class="info-box">
  <p class="info-box-title">🧬 Mating Genetics</p>
  <p>CLEAR × CLEAR = 100% CLEAR puppies<br>
  CLEAR × CARRIER = 50% CLEAR, 50% CARRIER (all healthy)<br>
  CARRIER × CARRIER = 25% CLEAR, 50% CARRIER, <strong>25% AFFECTED</strong> ⚠️</p>
  </div>
  
  <h2>What to Ask the Breeder</h2>
  
  <p>When looking for a Staffordshire Bull Terrier puppy, genetic testing is one of the fundamental criteria for evaluating breeder seriousness.</p>
  
  <h3>Documents to Request</h3>
  
  <ol>
  <li><strong>Original L2-HGA and HC test certificates</strong> for BOTH parents</li>
  <li>Certificates must be issued by recognized laboratories</li>
  <li>Check that names and microchips match those of the actual parents</li>
  </ol>
  
  <div class="callout">
  <p class="callout-title">🏆 Our Commitment</p>
  <p>At <a href="/en/">Del Piccolo Diavolo kennel</a>, ALL our breeding dogs are tested CLEAR for both L2-HGA and HC. We provide test certificates with every <a href="/en/puppies-staffordshire-bull-terrier/">puppy</a>. This is our commitment to puppy health and the breed's future.</p>
