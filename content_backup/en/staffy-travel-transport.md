  <strong>In brief:</strong> Staffordshire Bull Terriers generally travel well with proper preparation. Their compact size makes them suitable for various transport options, but safety and comfort should always be priorities.
  </div>
  
  <h2>Car travel safety</h2>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Crate:</strong> Safest option, secured in boot or back seat</li>
  <li><strong>Harness:</strong> Crash-tested car harness attached to seat belt</li>
  <li><strong>Never:</strong> Loose in car, in front seat, head out window</li>
  <li>Regular breaks every 2-3 hours for water and toilet</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Getting your dog used to car travel</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>Start with engine off, just sitting in car</li>
  <li>Short drives around the block, gradually increasing</li>
  <li>Pair car journeys with positive destinations (not just vet!)</li>
  <li>Feed a small meal 2 hours before travel to prevent car sickness</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Public transport</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>Check local rules - muzzle requirements vary by region/company</li>
  <li>Practice calm behavior around crowds and noise</li>
  <li>Travel during off-peak times when possible</li>
  <li>Bring water, treats and a mat for the dog to lie on</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Flying with your Staffy</h2>
  <p>Brachycephalic restrictions may apply to Staffies on some airlines due to their head shape. Check airline policies carefully. In-cabin travel typically limited to small dogs in carriers that fit under seats - Staffies usually need cargo hold travel.</p>

  </div>
  
  <h2>Finding pet-friendly accommodation</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>Book well in advance - pet rooms are often limited</li>
  <li>Confirm size and breed restrictions</li>
  <li>Bring familiar bedding and items</li>
  <li>Plan exercise opportunities near accommodation</li>
  </ul>
